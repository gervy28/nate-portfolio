### Main Build Componenets

-Bootstrap Vue: New Library for me, extends the Bootstrap library making components like Carousels, Buttons, etc function like Vue components. Still makes Utility classes available
-Vue Router: simple to use router
-FontAwesome: makes icon generation, especially for brands simple!

### Future Site Direction

This website is a very simple portfolio. If it isn't responsive already, it should be. Otherwise, I designed this thinking that it could be connected to a database in the future. Design could also be vastly improved. 


### Site Improvements:
>-Entire Site: Make all text filled with data rather than hard coded, then can easily use Axios to connect backend data
>-Repeated Imports On View Routers
>-Entire Site:
>>-Allow scrollable of entire view below 430 pixels
>>-font colors could be more universally described
>-Sidebar
>>-Breakpoint @ 968
>>-Menu Footer: 
>>>-Excellent place for a suite of tests to determine if the links work and produce a URL directing towards the right site
