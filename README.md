# nate-portfolio
This is an evolving project. If it doesn't look so good, I've sent it to you early in my job hunt!
I launched this project as a way to practice Vue.JS and show some of my skills as a developer. 

**Approximate Project Time:** 12 hours 


### Site Improvements:
There is a lot to do to make this site better! And I will continue to improve every aspect. I organize these as almost sprints. Once I brought it to an MVP I backed of slightly and now work on different portions in highly focused sprints. 

> **Make Responsive**
>> - adjust scrollablity below 430 pixels (the entire thing needs to scroll)
>> - adjust menu to hide on smaller screens
>> - better wrapping on project cards
>> - sidebar breakpoint @968

>**Improve Security and Reliability**
>> - Google maps API key not well hidden
>> - Implement a full suite of tests 

>**Collaborate with a Designer**
>> - I can't design well, I should get someone to help make it seem less plain

>**Other Ideas**
>> - Connect to Laravel app or some other backend
>> - Turn into a small CMS allowing non-developers to make a cool portolio
>> - Create more detailed supporting pages that make it more blog like
>> - Improve the overall documentation to help other developers use it
>> - Turn into a YouTube tutorial on how to make a basic portfolio

### Main Build Componenets

-Bootstrap Vue: New Library for me, extends the Bootstrap library making components like Carousels, Buttons, etc function like Vue components. Still makes Utility classes available
-Vue Router: simple to use router
-FontAwesome: makes icon generation, especially for brands simple!

### Future Site Direction

This website is a very simple portfolio. If it isn't responsive already, it should be. Otherwise, I designed this thinking that it could be connected to a database in the future. Design could also be vastly improved.
